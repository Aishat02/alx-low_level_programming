## About

- This repository consists of all the C programming projects done with [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/) Full stack Software Engineering course in partnership with [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) by Titilayo Tijani.
- All main.c files are prewritten by the school. We build functions that produce a specific output while also taking into consideration edge cases.

- [0x00](./0x00-hello_world) : Hello, World.
- [0x01](./0x01-variables_if_else_while) : Variables,if,else,while.
- [0x02](./0x02-functions_nested_loops) : Functions, nested loops.
- [0x03](./0x03-debugging) : Debugging.
- [0x04](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops) : More Functions and nested loops.
- [0x05](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings) : Pointers, arrays and strings.
- [0x06](./0x06-pointers_arrays_strings) : More pointers, arrays and strings.
- [0x07](./0x07-pointers_arrays_strings) : Even more pointers, arrays and strings.
